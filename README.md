Highlight Insight:
---
The dashboard shows that Friday and Saturday have the highest number of orders, especially during lunchtime. This indicates that weekends are the busiest period, requiring special strategies to optimize sales. The Classic category contributes the most to total sales, with Large pizzas generating the highest revenue. However, XX-Large pizzas have a very small contribution. In terms of product performance, the Classic Deluxe Pizza is the best seller, while the Brie Carre Pizza has the lowest sales, along with several other less popular variants.

Recomendations :
---
Based on these insights, promotional strategies can focus on discounts or special bundling packages on weekends to drive more sales. Additionally, increasing staff and inventory during weekend and lunchtime can help manage order surges. To boost the contribution of small, X-large, and XX-Large pizzas, upselling strategies or price evaluations can be implemented. Further analysis is needed for the lowest-performing products, considering factors such as taste, pricing, and marketing to enhance their appeal.
